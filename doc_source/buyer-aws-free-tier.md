# Using AWS Free Tier with AWS Marketplace<a name="buyer-aws-free-tier"></a>

 To help new AWS customers get started in the cloud, AWS introduced a free usage tier\. The free tier can be used for anything you want to run in the cloud: launch new applications, test existing applications in the cloud, or simply gain hands\-on experience with AWS\. When the free usage period expires \(or if the application use exceeds the free usage tier limits\), you simply pay the standard, pay\-as\-you\-go service rates\. For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.

 AWS Free Tier customers are eligible to use free AWS Marketplace software for up to 750 hours of EC2 usage each month for one year\. To get started, see [AWS Marketplace](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/)\.
