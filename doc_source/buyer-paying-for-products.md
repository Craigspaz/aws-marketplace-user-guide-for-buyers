# Paying for products<a name="buyer-paying-for-products"></a>

At the beginning of the month, you receive a bill from Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) for your AWS Marketplace charges\. For software products, the bill includes a calculation of the hourly fee for the software multiplied by the number of hours any Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) instance with this software runs\. You also receive a bill for usage of AWS infrastructure services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\), and for bandwidth\. 

If your AWS account is based in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa \(EMEA\), excluding Turkey and South Africa, and your purchase is from an EMEA\-eligible seller, you receive a bill from Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL \(AWS Europe\)\. Otherwise, you receive a bill from AWS Inc\. 

**Note**  
For contract purchases, the invoice for the subscription fees happens at the time of subscription, rather than in the consolidated monthly bill\. Flexible payments on contracts are invoiced at the time of the scheduled payment\. For contracts that have usage components \(pay as you go\), the usage appears in your consolidated monthly bill\.

AWS Marketplace products using complex topologies may incur charges for clusters of AMIs and other AWS infrastructure services launched by the provided AWS CloudFormation template\. 

For example, suppose that you run software for 720 hours on an EC2 small instance type\. The seller's fee for software usage is $0\.12 per hour and the EC2 charges are $0\.085 per hour\. At the end of the month, you are billed $147\.60\.

## Updating remittance instructions<a name="Updating-remittance-instructions"></a>

Customers with AWS accounts based in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa \(EMEA\), excluding Turkey and South Africa, who have purchased software products from EMEA\-eligible sellers receive a bill from Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL\. Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL \(AWS Europe\) invoices have different remittance instructions from AWS, Inc\. You can find remittance information on your bills when signed in to the [AWS Billing and Cost Management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)\. The bank accounts listed under the remittance information portion of the invoice are different from AWS Cloud services purchases through Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL\. Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL uses Amazon Payments Europe, S\.C\.A\., a licensed electronic money institution in Luxembourg, as its payment processor for AWS Marketplace invoices\. All invoices must be settled in full\. Any payments that don't cover the full invoice amount will be refunded to your bank account\.

The following table outlines the transaction types, the transacting entity, and the corresponding remittance instructions \(**Account Name** listed under **Electronic funds transfer details** on the invoice\)\.


| Type of transaction | Transacting entity | Remittance instructions  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| AWS Cloud services purchases | Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL | Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL | 
| Eligible AWS Marketplace seller | Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL | Amazon Payments Europe, S\.C\.A\.  | 
| Ineligible AWS Marketplace seller | AWS Inc\. | AWS | 

To request a bank letter for the remittance instructions, select **Billing or account support** and create an **Account and billing support** case at [Contact AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) or send an email message to awslux\-receivables\-support@email\.amazon\.com\.
