# Paying for products<a name="buyer-paying-for-products"></a>

Your AWS Marketplace purchases are displayed in the currency you specified for your AWS account\. You can change your preferred currency for your account in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console\. For instructions, see [Changing which currency you use to pay your bill](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment.html#manage-account-payment-change-currency) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.

**Note**  
 Changing your preferred currency changes your remittance instructions\. To view updated remittance instructions, see your AWS Marketplace invoice or view the **Account Settings** page in the [AWS Billing and Cost Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#account) console\.

At the beginning of the month, you receive a bill from Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) for your AWS Marketplace charges\. For software products, the bill includes a calculation of the hourly fee for the software multiplied by the number of hours any Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) instance with this software runs\. You also receive a bill for usage of AWS infrastructure services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\), and bandwidth\. 

**Note**  
For contract purchases, the invoice for the subscription fees happens at the time of subscription, rather than in the consolidated monthly bill\. Flexible payments on contracts are invoiced at the time of the scheduled payment\. For contracts that have usage components \(pay as you go\), the usage appears in your consolidated monthly bill\.

AWS Marketplace products using complex topologies may incur charges for clusters of AMIs and other AWS infrastructure services launched by the provided AWS CloudFormation template\. 

For example, suppose that you run software for 720 hours on an EC2 small instance type\. The seller's fee for software usage is $0\.12 per hour and the EC2 charges are $0\.085 per hour\. At the end of the month, you are billed $147\.60\.
