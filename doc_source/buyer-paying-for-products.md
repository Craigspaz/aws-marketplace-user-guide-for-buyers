# Paying For Products<a name="buyer-paying-for-products"></a>

At the beginning of the month, you will receive a bill from Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) for your AWS Marketplace charges\. For software products, the bill will include a calculation of the hourly fee for the software multiplied by the number of hours any Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) instance with this software was running\. You will also receive a bill for usage of AWS infrastructure services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\), Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\), and bandwidth\. 

AWS Marketplace products using complex topologies may incur charges for clusters of AMIs and other AWS infrastructure services launched by the provided AWS CloudFormation template\. 

 For example, consider a customer that runs software for 1,000 hours on an EC2 small instance type\. In this example, the vendorâ€™s fee for software usage is $0\.12/hr and the EC2 charges are $0\.085/hr\. At the end of the month, the customer is billed a total of $205\.00\.
