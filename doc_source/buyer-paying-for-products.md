# Paying For Products<a name="buyer-paying-for-products"></a>

 At the beginning of the month, you will receive a bill from AWS for your AWS Marketplace charges, which will include a calculation of the hourly fee for the software multiplied by the number of hours any AMI instance with this software was running\. You will also receive a bill for usage of AWS infrastructure services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\), and bandwidth\. 

AWS Marketplace products using complex topologies may incur charges for clusters of AMIs and other AWS infrastructure services launched by the provided AWS CloudFormation template\. 

 For example, consider a customer that runs software for 1000 hours on an EC2 small instance type\. If the vendorâ€™s fee for software usage is $0\.12/hr and the EC2 charges in the example is $0\.085/hr, then at the end of the month, the customer is billed a total of $205\.00\. 

## Frequently Asked Questions<a name="paying-for-products-frequently-asked-questions"></a>

### Why do charges for products that are "sold by" Amazon Web Services not appear as a separate software line item, like other products do?<a name="why-do-charges-for-products-that-are-sold-by-amazon-web-services-not-appear-as-a-separate-software-line-item-like-other-products-do"></a>

 Products that are *sold by* Amazon Web Services use a slightly different mechanism for tracking usage so the customer experience is a little different too\. For these products, you do not need to choose **Accept terms** before using these products\. Their terms of use are included in AWS Service terms\. Because you do not need to subscribe, you will not receive a confirmation email the first time you use it\. 

 These products will not appear in **Your Software**, but you can find them by searching for them\. Additionally, charges for these products will appear on your bill as part of your Amazon EC2 charges, not as a separate software line item\. 

### Why do some products show that taxes have been collected?<a name="why-do-some-products-show-that-taxes-have-been-collected"></a>

 U\.S\. sales and use tax might be collected, depending on where you are located and how the company selling their product have configured their products in AWS Marketplace\. 

### What if I am tax exempt?<a name="what-if-i-am-tax-exempt"></a>

 Many organizations qualify to make tax exempt purchases based on state law\. The Amazon Tax Exemption Program \(ATEP\) supports sales tax exempt purchases\. Contact your tax advisor to determine if your purchases qualify for sales tax exemption\. To enroll in the ATEP, navigate to [Amazon Tax Exemption Program \(ATEP\)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202036350) and complete the enrollment process\. 

### What is a 9a VAT invoice?<a name="what-is-a-9a-vat-invoice"></a>

 A 9a Value Added Tax \(VAT\) invoice is a document that is designed specifically to address the requirements of the European Union VAT directive\. Starting April 19, 2018, you will receive a 9a VAT invoice for your purchase through AWS Marketplace only if you are a business customer \(provided a valid Tax Registration Number in the AWS billing console\) with a legal address for the business in the European Union\. You can find more information about Article 9a [in this PDF file](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/telecom/explanatory_notes_2015_en.pdf)\. 

### Why is there no VAT charge on the 9a VAT invoice?<a name="why-is-there-no-vat-charge-on-the-9a-vat-invoice"></a>

 According to Article 9a of the European Union VAT Regulations \(number 2011/282/EC\), any VAT, associated accounting, and invoicing obligations are transferred from the seller to the AWS Marketplace operator, for VAT purposes only\. To achieve this, the sale by the seller will be treated \(for VAT purposes only\) as a sale to AWS, followed by a sale \(for VAT purposes only\) by AWS to you, with you being a business customer who has provided a valid Tax Registration Number in your AWS billing console\. AWS Marketplace is not required to account for VAT on sales to business customers located in the European Union\. As a business customer, you are responsible to self\-assess VAT under the reverse\-charge mechanism, if required by your local regulations\. AWS Marketplace charges local VAT on sales to private \(non\-business\) customers located in the European Union\. 

### Why do I not receive a 9a VAT invoice for AWS services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) and Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)?<a name="why-do-i-not-receive-a-9a-vat-invoice-for-aws-services-like-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2-and-amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3"></a>

 The 9a VAT invoice is applicable only to electronically supplied services sold by third party sellers on AWS Marketplace\. AWS services like Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are sold by Amazon Web Services, Inc\. and, hence, not included on the 9a VAT invoice\.
