# Free trials<a name="buyer-free-trials"></a>

Some products listed on AWS Marketplace offer free trials\. The free trial enables you to try the software before you buy it\. Free trials are limited to a certain amount of free usage, or for a specific amount of time\. You can't pause a free trial period once it starts\.

**Note**  
Users of free trials are billed for underlying resource usage\. For example, if you subscribe to an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) product that has a free trial, you are not charged for use of the AMI during the free trial period, but you may be charged for the Amazon EC2 instance that you run it on\.
