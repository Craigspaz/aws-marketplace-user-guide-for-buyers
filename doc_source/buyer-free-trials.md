# Free trials<a name="buyer-free-trials"></a>

Some products listed on AWS Marketplace offer free trials\. The free trial enables you to try the software before you buy it\. Free trials are limited to a certain amount of free usage, or for a specific amount of time\. You can't pause a free trial period once it starts\.

## Software and infrastructure pricing<a name="software-and-infrastructure-pricing"></a>

Free trials offered by sellers only apply to the software pricing of their product listed on AWS Marketplace\. Buyers are responsible for all infrastructure costs while using a seller's product from AWS Marketplace regardless of whether the software pricing includes a free trial\. These infrastructure costs are set by AWS and are available on their respective pricing pages\. For example, if you subscribe to an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) product that has a free trial, you aren't charged for use of the AMI during the free trial\. However, you might be charged for the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instance on which you run the AMI product\.

**Note**  
Some products might require additional AWS infrastructure to perform\. For example, sellers might provide deployment instructions or templates that deploy load balancers, storage, databases, or other AWS services into your AWS account\. To understand what AWS services the seller has required for their product, review the detail pages for products listed on AWS Marketplace\. Then, review the pricing pages of those AWS services\.

## Free trials for AMI\-based products<a name="free-trials-for-ami-based-products"></a>

Some AMI products with hourly or hourly with annual pricing in AWS Marketplace have free trials\. When you subscribe to a free trial, you can run one Amazon EC2 instance of the AMI product for a duration set by the seller without incurring the hourly software charges\. You're responsible for the infrastructure charge\. Launching additional Amazon EC2 instances will incur the hourly software charge per instance\. Free trials automatically convert to a paid subscription upon expiration\. 

If you don't terminate the Amazon EC2 instance before the free trial ends, you'll incur hourly software charges when the free trial ends\. Unsubscribing to the free trial doesn't automatically end your Amazon EC2 instances, and you incur software charges for any continued use\. For more information about infrastructure charges, see the [Amazon EC2 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)\.

## Free trials for container\-based products<a name="free-trials-for-container-based-products"></a>

Some container products with hourly or hourly with long\-term pricing in AWS Marketplace have free trials\. When you subscribe to a free trial, you can run several Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\) tasks or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\) pods for a duration without incurring hourly software charges\. The number of tasks or pods included and the duration of the free trial are set by the seller\. You're responsible for the infrastructure charge\. Launching additional tasks or pods beyond the number included in the free trial will incur the hourly software charge per task or pod\. Free trials automatically convert to a paid subscription upon expiration\. 

If you don't terminate the task or pod before the free trial ends, you'll incur hourly software charges when the free trial ends\. Unsubscribing to the free trial doesn't automatically end your tasks or pods, and you incur software charges for any continued use\. For more information about infrastructure charges, see [Amazon ECS pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/pricing/) and [Amazon EKS pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/)\.

Some machine learning products with hourly pricing in AWS Marketplace have free trials\. When you subscribe to a free trial, you can run Amazon SageMaker endpoints, batch transform jobs, or training jobs for a duration set by the seller without incurring the hourly software charges\. You're responsible for the infrastructure charge\. Free trials automatically convert to a paid subscription upon expiration\. 

If you don't terminate any Amazon SageMaker endpoints, batch transform jobs, or training jobs before the free trial ends, you'll incur hourly software charges when the free trial ends\. Unsubscribing to the free trial doesn't automatically end your Amazon SageMaker endpoints, batch transform jobs, or training jobs, and you incur software charges for any continued use\. For more information about infrastructure charges, see [Amazon SageMaker Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/)\.

## Free trials for SaaS products<a name="free-trials-for-saas-products"></a>

Some software as a service \(SaaS\) products with contract pricing in AWS Marketplace have free trials\. SaaS contract free trials don't automatically convert into paid agreements\.
