# What Is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that makes it easy for customers to find, buy, deploy, and manage third\-party software and services that customers need to build solutions and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, business intelligence, database, and devOps\. AWS Marketplace also simplifies software licensing and procurement with flexible pricing options and multiple deployment methods\. 

Customers can quickly launch pre\-configured software with just a few clicks, and choose software solutions in AMI and SaaS formats, as well as other formats\. Flexible pricing options include free trial, hourly, monthly, annual, multi\-year, and BYOL, and get billed from one source, AWS\.” 

 AWS handles billing and payments, and software charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\. 

 You use AWS Marketplace as a subscriber \(buyer\) or as a provider \(seller\), or both\. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a consumer, and can register to become a provider\. A provider can be an independent software vendor \(ISV\), value\-added reseller, or individual that has something to offer that works with AWS products and services\.

 Every product on AWS Marketplace has been through a curation process\. On the listing page, there can be one or more offerings for the product\. When the provider submits a product in AWS Marketplace, they define the price of the product, and the terms and conditions of use\. When a consumer subscribes to a product offering, they agree to the pricing, and terms and conditions set for the offer\. 

 The product can be free to use or can have an associated charge\. The charge becomes part of your AWS bill, and once you pay, AWS Marketplace pays the provider\. Products can take many forms\. For instance, a product can be offered as an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) or Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) that can be instantiated using your AWS account\. The product could also be configured to use AWS CloudFormation templates for delivery to the consumer\. The product could also be software as a service \(SaaS\) offerings from an ISV, or a web ACL, set of rules, or conditions for AWS WAF\. 

 Products can be purchased at the listed price using the ISV’s standard end user license agreement \(EULA\) or offered with customer pricing and EULA\. Products can also be purchased under a contract with specified time or usage boundaries\. Once the product subscriptions are in place, the consumer can copy the product to their AWS Service Catalog to manage how the product is accessed and used in the consumer’s organization\. 

## Using AWS Marketplace as a Subscriber<a name="using-aws-marketplace-as-a-subscriber"></a>

 As a subscriber, you visit [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) to search or navigate to a product that runs on Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)\. The software can be available in many forms, including AMIs and SaaS products\. When you choose a product, you are taken to the product’s listing page\. The page has information about the product, pricing, usage, support, and product reviews\. To subscribe to the product, you log in to your AWS account and are taken to a subscription page that has the EULA, terms and conditions of usage, and any options available for customizing your subscription\. 

 Once the subscription is processed, you can configure fulfillment options, software versions, and regions you want to use the product on, and then launch the product\. You can also find or launch your products by visiting [Your Marketplace Software](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/library?ref_=header_user_your_software) on the AWS Marketplace website, from your AWS Marketplace or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) console, or through AWS Service Catalog\. 

## Using AWS Marketplace as a Provider<a name="using-aws-marketplace-as-a-provider"></a>

 As a provider, you visit the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/) \(AMMP\) to register\. If you charge for use of your product, you must also provide tax and banking information as part of your registration\. You create a profile for your company or yourself that is discoverable on AWS Marketplace\. You can also create product listing for your products using a self\-service listing tool\. Examples of products you can create include: 
+  AMIs where customers can bring their own license\. 
+  AMIs where the price is free\. 
+  AMIs with hourly or hourly\-annual pricing options\. 
+  SaaS products that you subscribe to and pay for usage\. 
+  SaaS products you subscribe to with specific usage amounts\. 
+  Single AMI products fulfilled using AWS CloudFormation templates\. 
+  Multiple AMI products fulfilled using AWS CloudFormation templates\. 
+  AMI products with pricing based on a month’s usage\. 

 Once you are registered as a provider, you use the AMMP to manage your account and products, and to access reports of usage of your products\.
