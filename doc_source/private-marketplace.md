Your business users and engineering teams can find, buy, and deploy products from your private marketplace, and ensure that all available products comply with your organization’s policies and standards\. 

 Your private marketplace is shared across [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/)\. AWS Organizations enables you to create a series of accounts linked for permissions and payments\.

Private Marketplace gives you broad catalog of products you select, as well as fine\-grained control\. For the members of your organization, procuring products is efficient and simplified\.
