# Container Products<a name="buyer-what-is-aws-marketplace-for-containers"></a>

 AWS Marketplace for Containers enables you to discover, procure, and deploy free, bring\-your\-own\-license \(BYOL\), and pay\-as\-you\-go container products from independent software vendors \(ISVs\) for use with supported runtimes and services, such as [Amazon Elastic Container Service](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) \(Amazon ECS\) and [Amazon Elastic Container Services for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) \(Amazon EKS\)\. You can use either the AWS Marketplace website or the Amazon ECS console to find container products that you can try, buy, and launch\. These will be either standalone products fulfilled as Docker container images or container\-based agents that work with existing AWS Marketplace software\-as\-a\-service \(SaaS\) products\. You will be able to deploy many products to Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS by using ISV\-supplied deployment templates, such as task definitions or Helm charts, and you will also be able to access container images directly from private [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](http://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) \(Amazon ECR\) repositories once you have subscribed to those products\. 

 Free and BYOL products are available for use on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS\. Paid products are also available for Amazon ECS, which can operate in two modes: [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) launch type and [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) \(Amazon EC2\) launch type\. For paid products, you will be billed via AWS as with any AWS Marketplace product according to the pricing model, which may be a fixed monthly fee or an hourly price that is charged per\-second\. We will offer paid products for Amazon EKS at a later date\. 

 This guide explains how to use AWS Marketplace for Containers to find, purchase and launch container products, with examples of tasks you should perform, test, and validate to provide feedback to the AWS Marketplace team\.

## Docker Containers and Kubernetes<a name="buyer-introduction-to-docker-containers-and-kubernetes"></a>

 [Docker](https://aws.amazon.com/docker/) containers are an open\-source software technology that provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation over virtualized operating systems such as Linux and Windows Server\. Just as virtual machines are instances of server images, containers are instances of Docker container images\. They wrap server application software in a file system that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and so on\. This guarantees that the software always runs the same, regardless of its environment\. Analogous to Java virtual machines, containers require an underlying platform to provide a translation and orchestration layer while being isolated from the operating system and each other\. There are different Docker\-compatible runtimes and orchestration services that you can use with Docker containers, including Amazon ECS, which is a highly scalable, high\-performance orchestration service for AWS, and Amazon EKS, which makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using [Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/kubernetes/), an open source management and orchestration service\.
