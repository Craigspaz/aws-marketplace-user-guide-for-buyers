AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights simplifies software risk assessments by helping you to procure software that you trust and that meets your industry standards\.With AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights, you can monitor the security profile of a product in near real\-time from a single user interface\. It reduces your assessment effort by providing a dashboard of a software product’s security information\. You can use the dashboard to view and evaluate information, such as data privacy, application security, and access control\. 

AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights provides evidence\-based information from 10 control categories and multiple controls\. It gathers the evidence\-based information from three sources: 
+ **Vendor production accounts** – Of the multiple controls, 30 controls support live evidence gathering from vendor production accounts\. Live evidence for each control is generated by one or more AWS Config rules that evaluate the configuration settings of vendor AWS resources\. AWS Audit Manager captures the evidence and delivers it to the AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights dashboard\. 
+ **Vendor ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II reports** – The control categories are mapped to controls in the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) and Service Organization Control \(SOC\) 2 reports\. When vendors share these reports with AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights, the service extracts the relevant data and presents it in the dashboard\.
+ **Vendor self\-assessment** – Vendors complete a self\-assessment in AWS Audit Manager\.
