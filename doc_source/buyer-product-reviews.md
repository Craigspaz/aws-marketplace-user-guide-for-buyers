# Product Reviews<a name="buyer-product-reviews"></a>

AWS Marketplace wants subscribers to get the information they need to make smart buying choices, and we'd love to have your help doing that\. As an AWS customer, you can submit written reviews for items listed in AWS Marketplace\. We encourage you to share your opinions, both favorable and unfavorable\. 

**Note**  
Data products don't support product reviews\.

## Who can create customer reviews?<a name="who-can-create-customer-reviews"></a>

 Anyone with an AWS Marketplace subscription to a product can create a review for it\. All we ask is that you follow a few rules\. 

## What should I include in my review?<a name="what-should-i-include-in-my-review"></a>
+  *Include the why* – The best reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked a product, but also why\. Feel free to talk about related products and how this item compares to them\. 
+  *Be specific* – Your review should focus on specific features of the product and your experience with it\. For video reviews, we recommend that you write a brief introduction\. 
+  *Not too short, not too long* – Written reviews must be at least 20 words and are limited to 5,000 words\. The ideal length is 75–500 words\. 
+  *Be sincere* – We welcome your honest opinion about the product, positive or negative\. We do not remove reviews because they are critical\. We believe that all helpful information can inform our customers’ buying decisions\. 
+  *Full disclosure* – If you received a free product in exchange for your review, clearly and conspicuously disclose that you received the product free of charge\.
