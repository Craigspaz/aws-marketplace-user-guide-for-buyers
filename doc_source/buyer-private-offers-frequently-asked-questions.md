## When I Purchase Software Using Private Offers, Does It Change How I Can Use the Software?<a name="when-i-purchase-software-using-private-offer-does-it-change-how-the-software-can-be-used"></a>

 No\. The software that you purchase behaves the same as it would if you purchased the software without a private offer\. 

## Iâ€™m a Software Buyer\. How Do I Check My Usage of Products Purchased Through AWS Marketplace Private Offers?<a name="im-a-software-buyer.-how-do-i-check-my-usage-of-products-purchased-through-aws-marketplace-seller-private-offer"></a>

 Products with a private offer show up like any other AWS Marketplace product in your monthly bill\. You can use detailed billing to view your usage for each of your AWS Marketplace purchased products\. Each of your private offers has a line item corresponding to each kind of usage\.

## Does Subscribing to a Private Offer Launch an Instance?<a name="does-subscribing-to-a-private-offer-launch-an-instance"></a>

 No\. Subscribing to a private offer doesn't require launching a new instance of the software\. Accepting the private offer modifies the price to correspond to your private offer price\. If a product offers 1\-click launch, you can deploy a new instance of the software\. If a product defaults to 1\-click launch, you can accept a private offer without launching a new instance\. To launch without deploying a new instance, choose **Manual Launch** on the fulfillment page\. You can use the Amazon EC2 console to deploy additional instances, just as you would for other AWS Marketplace products\. 

## I'm a Software Buyer\. How Do I Know Which Account ID the Software Seller Used to Create the Private Offer?<a name="im-a-software-buyer.-how-do-i-know-which-account-id-master-payer-the-software-seller-used-to-create-the-private-offer"></a>

 When the software seller extends a private offer to you, you receive confirmation on the account included in a private offer\. Private offers are linked to the specific software buyer's account listed\. The software seller creates the private offer for the account that you specify\. Each private offer can be made to up to 25 accounts\.

## I'm a Software Buyer\. How Can I Tell Which Existing Instances Are Hourly and Which Are Annual?<a name="i-am-a-software-buyer-how-can-i-tell-which-existing-instances-are-hourly-and-which-are-annual"></a>

 You can review all of your annual subscriptions in AWS Marketplace under **Your Software**\. If an annual subscription is purchased by one account using AWS Organizations for consolidated billing, it is shared across the entire linked account family\. If the purchasing account doesn't have any running instances, the annual subscription is counted toward the usage in another linked account running that software\. For more information about annual subscriptions, see [AMI Subscriptions](buyer-ami-subscriptions.md)\. 

## How Do I Subscribe to a Private Offer That Has Expired?<a name="how-do-i-subscribe-to-a-private-offer"></a>

When a private offer expires, you can't subscribe to it\. However, you can contact the product vendor and ask them to create a new private offer for you\. The product vendor also has the option of authorizing AWS Marketplace to extend the offer\. If you're interested in trying to get the expiration date extended, email mpcustdesk@amazon\.com\.

## Does AWS Marketplace Provide Financing Services for Private Offers?<a name="can-i-get-financing-for-private-offers"></a>

No\. AWS Marketplace doesn't provide financing services for private offers\.

## My Company Participates in the AWS Enterprise Discount Program\. Is My Discount Applied to Private Offers?<a name="do-edp-program-participants-get-their-discount-on-private-offers"></a>

No\. Your discount doesn't apply to AWS Marketplace charges\. Private offers are invoiced based on your agreement with the product vendor and appear on the Billing and Cost Management console by the third day of the following month\. We consolidate and apply any discounts and send you an enterprise discount program summary bill\.
