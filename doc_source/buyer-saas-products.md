# SaaS products<a name="buyer-saas-products"></a>

 For software as a service \(SaaS\) products, you subscribe to products through AWS Marketplace, but you access the product in the software seller's environment\. AWS Marketplace oﬀers the following pricing models\. 

**Topics**
+ [SaaS usage\-based subscriptions](#saas-subscriptions)
+ [SaaS upfront commitments](#buyer-saas-contracts)
+ [SaaS free trials for contracts](#saas-free-trials-for-contracts)

## SaaS usage\-based subscriptions<a name="saas-subscriptions"></a>

With SaaS usage\-based subscriptions, the software seller tracks your usage and you pay only for what you use\. This pay\-as\-you go pricing model is similar to that of many AWS services\. Billing for your usage of a SaaS product is managed through your AWS bill\. 

## SaaS upfront commitments<a name="buyer-saas-contracts"></a>

Some companies make SaaS contracts available upfront for purchase through AWS Marketplace\. With this option, you can purchase discrete quantities of licenses or data ingest for these products\. Then, you can bill these products, in advance, through your AWS account\. For example, you might purchase 10 user access licenses for a year, or you might purchase 10 GB of data ingest per day for a year\.

If this option is available, **Software as a Service \(SaaS\) Contracts** appears for **Delivery Method** on the product’s detail page\. When you make the purchase, you're directed to the product’s website for account setup and configuration\. The usage charges then appear on your regular AWS account billing report\.

**To subscribe with a SaaS contract**

1.  Choose **Continue** to start the subscription\. You can choose the quantities or units you want, length of subscription \(if multiple options are available\), and automatic renewal\. 

1.  After you have made your selections, choose **Create Contract**\. 

1.  Choose **Set Up Your Account**, which takes you to the company’s website\. While your account is being configured and the payment is being verified, you will see your contract is pending on the AWS Marketplace details page for the product\.  

 After configuration is complete, a link to set up your account is available on the product page\. The software appears under **Your Marketplace Software** when you're signed in to your AWS Marketplace account\. You can now start using the software\. If you don't complete the setup process for your account, you are prompted to do so when you revisit that product on AWS Marketplace\. 

Access the software subscription from the software company’s website using the account you created on their website\. You can also find website links for any software subscriptions you purchased through AWS Marketplace under **Your Marketplace Software** when you're signed in to your AWS Marketplace account\. 

## SaaS free trials for contracts<a name="saas-free-trials-for-contracts"></a>

Some vendors offer SaaS free trials for contracts through AWS Marketplace\. You can search through SaaS products on AWS Marketplace and filter results to only show those with free trials\. Search results indicate which products offer free trials\. On the product procurement page, you can find the duration of the free trial period and how much free software usage is included in the trial\. 

During the free trial, while evaluating SaaS contract products, you can make a purchase decision by negotiating a private offer or subscribing to a public offer\. After your free trial expires, you can also upgrade to a paid or private offer\. SaaS contract free trials won't automatically convert into paid agreements\. If you no longer want the free trial, you can let the free trial expire\. View your subscriptions by selecting **Manage subscriptions** from the AWS Marketplace console\. All free trial products display the **Free trial** badge\.

**Note**  
Each AWS account is only eligible for 1 free trial per product\.
