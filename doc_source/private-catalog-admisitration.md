# Creating and Managing a Private Marketplace<a name="private-catalog-admisitration"></a>

 To create and manage a private marketplace you must have the IAM permissions found in the `AWSPrivateMarketplaceAdminFullAccess` IAM policy\. For information on applying this policy to IAM users, groups, and roles, see [Creating a Private Marketplace IT Administrator](it-administrator.md)\.

## Creating Your Private Marketplace<a name="create-your-private-marketplace"></a>

 To create your private marketplace, navigate to [Private Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pmp/getstarted) and choose **Create a Private Marketplace**\.

## Adding Products to Your Private Marketplace<a name="add-products-to-your-private-marketplace"></a>

 To add products to your organization’s private marketplace: 

1.  From the **Private Marketplace** administrator page, on the **Products** tab, choose **All AWS Marketplace products**\. You can search by product name or vendor name to find a product to add to your private marketplace\.

1.  Select the check box next to each product that you want to add to your private marketplace and then choose **Add to Private Marketplace**\.

 To verify that a product is in your private marketplace, from the **Private Marketplace** search page, search for the product that you added and choose it\. You are redirected to the product detail page for that product\. If the product isn't in your private marketplace, a red banner appears at the top of the page\. To add the product to your private marketplace, choose **Add** in the red banner\. 

 You can return to the **Private Marketplace** administrator page at any time to add or remove other products\. 

## Customizing Your Private Marketplace<a name="customize-your-private-marketplace"></a>

 Once you have added products to your private marketplace, from the **Private Marketplace** administrator page, you can choose the **Profile** tab to configure your organization’s private marketplace profile\. 

 You can add a logo, create a custom welcome message, and customize to use your organization’s color scheme\. Instructions to customize your private marketplace are available on the profile page\. 

## Configuring Your Private Marketplace<a name="configure-your-private-marketplace"></a>

 After you are satisfied with your product list and your look and feel, enable your private marketplace\. To enable or disable your private marketplace, from the **AWS Private Marketplace** administrators page, under **Private Marketplace status**, you can toggle the private marketplace status between **live** and **Not live**\. When your private marketplace is live, members of your organization can subscribe only to the products that you added to your private marketplace\. When your private marketplace is disabled, you retain the list of products\. However, disabling removes the procurement restriction control from users in your AWS Organizations organization\.
