# What is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third\-party software, data, and services that customers need to build solutions and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, IoT, business intelligence, database, and DevOps\. AWS Marketplace also simplifies software licensing and procurement with flexible pricing options and multiple deployment methods\. In addition, AWS Marketplace includes data products available from AWS Data Exchange\.

Customers can quickly launch pre\-configured software with just a few clicks, and choose software solutions in Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) and software as a service \(SaaS\) formats, as well as other formats\. Additionally, you can browse and subscribe to data products\. Flexible pricing options include free trial, hourly, monthly, annual, multi\-year, and BYOL, and get billed from one source\. AWS handles billing and payments, and charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\.

 You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer \(subscriber\) or as a seller \(provider\), or both\. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a consumer, and can register to become a seller\. A seller can be an independent software vendor \(ISV\), value\-added reseller, or individual that has something to offer that works with AWS products and services\. 

**Note**  
Data product providers need to meet the AWS Data Exchange eligibility requirements\. For more information, see [Providing Data Products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

Every software product on AWS Marketplace has been through a curation process\. On the product page, there can be one or more offerings for the product\. When the seller submits a product in AWS Marketplace, they define the price of the product, and the terms and conditions of use\. Buyers agree to the pricing, and terms and conditions set for the offer\. 

 The product can be free to use or can have an associated charge\. The charge becomes part of your AWS bill, and after you pay, AWS Marketplace pays the seller\. Products can take many forms\. For instance, a product can be offered as an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) that is instantiated using your AWS account\. The product could also be configured to use AWS CloudFormation templates for delivery to the consumer\. The product could also be software as a service \(SaaS\) offerings from an ISV, or a web ACL, set of rules, or conditions for AWS WAF\. 

Software products can be purchased at the listed price using the ISV’s standard end user license agreement \(EULA\) or offered with customer pricing and EULA\. Products can also be purchased under a contract with specified time or usage boundaries\. Once the product subscriptions are in place, the consumer can copy the product to their AWS Service Catalog to manage how the product is accessed and used in the consumer’s organization\. 

## Using AWS Marketplace as a buyer<a name="using-aws-marketplace-as-a-subscriber"></a>

As a buyer, you go to [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) to search, filter, and navigate to a product that runs on Amazon Web Services\. You can also find AWS Marketplace products on Deloitte and DLT\.

When you choose a software product, you are taken to the product’s page\. The page has information about the product, pricing, usage, support, and product reviews\. To subscribe to the software product, you log in to your AWS account and are taken to a subscription page that has the EULA, terms and conditions of usage, and any options available for customizing your subscription\. 

**Tip**  
Note the following tips about license terms and contracts:  
Many sellers offer the same standardized license terms on their listings, the *Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace \(SCMP\)*\. Instead of reviewing custom EULAs for each purchase, you only need to review the SCMP once\. The license terms are the same for all products that use the SCMP\. To find product listings that offer standardized license terms, use the **Standard Contract** filter when searching for products\. 
The *Enterprise Contract for AWS Marketplace \(ECMP\)* offers standardized license terms that address the unique requirements of large enterprise and regulated buyers\.
To learn more, see [Standardized License Terms](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/standardized-license-terms/)\.

After the subscription is processed, you can configure fulfillment options, software versions, and AWS Regions where you want to use the product, and then launch the software product\. You can also find or launch your products by visiting [Your Marketplace Software](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/library?ref_=header_user_your_software) on the AWS Marketplace website, from your AWS Marketplace or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) console, or through AWS Service Catalog\.
